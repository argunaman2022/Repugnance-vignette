      Thank you for completing part I.
      Several others have also completed part I in the last weeks.

      In this part your task is to <strong>guess the answers of others in Part I</strong>.
      <br><br>
      
      For example, in Part I you were asked whether "this transaction should be prevented", now you will be asked to guess 
      the the percentage of people who have answered "yes" to this question.
      <br><br>

        Bonus payment
      </h5>
      <!-- TODO: fix bonus -->
      Here you can earn up to XXX$ as bonus payment. 
      One of the questions will be randomly selected to determine your bonus payment. 
      In this randomly chosen question, the closer your guess is to the correct value the more bonus points you will earn.
      To maximize your bonus we advise you to give your best guess for each question.
      The exact rule for bonus calculation can be found at the end of the study.

      These instructions will be available to you at the bottom of the screen via the "Instructions" button.
