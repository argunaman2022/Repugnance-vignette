    <p>
        It is important to us that you have read and understood the instructions well.
        That is why we ask you to confirm your comprehension of the instructions by answering correctly the following <strong>3</strong> questions.
        Note that you have only <strong>2 attempts</strong> to answer the questions correctly. 
        If you answer a question incorrectly twice, we will have to ask you to return the study.
        Also note that you can always read the instructions again by clicking on the "Instructions" button below.
